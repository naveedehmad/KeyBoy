git clone https://github.com/naveedehmad/KeyBoy.git
cd KeyBoy && ./create-dmg.sh
```

### First Launch

1. **Launch** KeyBoy ‚Üí ‚å®Ô∏è appears in menu bar
2. **Grant** Accessibility permissions when prompted
3. **Test** default shortcuts: Right CMD + K/A/S/C/Z

### Default Shortcuts Out of the Box

|-------|------------|---------|
| `Right CMD + G` | Ghostty | Terminal |
| `Right CMD + A` | Arc | Browser |
| `Right CMD + S` | Slack | Communication |
| `Right CMD + C` | Claude | AI Assistant |
| `Right CMD + Z` | Zoom | Video Calls |

## üé® Configuration

### Visual Mode (Recommended)

Click ‚å®Ô∏è in menu bar ‚Üí **"Edit Shortcuts"**

- **Glass morphism interface** with smooth animations
- **Drag & drop** app selection from Applications folder  
- **Real-time validation** prevents configuration errors
- **App icon extraction** for visual shortcut management
- **One-click** add/edit/remove shortcuts

### JSON Mode (Power Users)

Direct configuration file editing:

```json
{
  "shortcuts": {
    "k": "/Applications/Ghostty.app",
    "a": "/Applications/Arc.app", 
    "s": "/Applications/Slack.app",
    "c": "/Applications/Claude.app",
    "z": "/Applications/zoom.us.app",
    "x": "/Applications/Xcode.app"
  },
  "settings": {
    "showNotifications": true,
    "playSound": false
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components

```
KeyBoy/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üî• HotkeyMonitor     # Precise Right CMD detection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚öôÔ∏è ConfigManager     # Hot-reload configuration  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üöÄ AppLauncher       # Smart app switching
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üé® FuturisticUI      # Glass morphism interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üîç AppIconExtractor  # Icon & metadata extraction
```

### Key Technical Innovations

- **Hardware key code detection** (54=Right CMD, 55=Left CMD)
- **Event tap hijacking** with selective suppression
- **File system monitoring** for configuration hot-reload
- **Bundle introspection** for app metadata extraction

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Shortcuts Not Working?

The #1 issue is **macOS permission caching**. Here's the bulletproof fix:

1. **System Settings** ‚Üí **Privacy & Security** ‚Üí **Accessibility**
2. **Remove KeyBoy** from the list (click ‚ûñ button)  
3. **Restart KeyBoy** ‚Üí Grant permissions again
4. **Test shortcuts** ‚Üí Should work immediately

This forces macOS to refresh its permission cache.

### Debug Console

```bash
# View real-time KeyBoy logs
log stream --predicate 'subsystem contains "KeyBoy"' --info

# Expected working output:
# ‚úÖ KeyBoy hotkey monitoring started successfully!
# üéØ Right CMD + k detected!
# ‚úÖ Launching: /Applications/Ghostty.app
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Root Cause | Solution |
|---------|------------|----------|
| "Failed to create event tap" | Missing permissions | Grant Accessibility access |
| "Permissions granted but not working" | macOS cache bug | Remove/re-add from Accessibility |
| "Right CMD not detected" | Hardware detection issue | Check Console logs |
| "App won't launch" | Invalid path | Verify app exists at path |
| "Left CMD affected" | Logic error | Check HotkeyMonitor implementation |

## üîí Security & Privacy

- ‚úÖ **Zero network access** - Works completely offline
- ‚úÖ **No data collection** - Zero telemetry or analytics
- ‚úÖ **Minimal permissions** - Only Accessibility for key monitoring  
- ‚úÖ **Open source** - Full transparency, audit-ready code
- ‚úÖ **Sandboxed** - App sandbox disabled only for file access

## üèóÔ∏è Development

### Build Requirements

- macOS Sequoia 15.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Right CMD key (obviously! üòÑ)

### Quick Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naveedehmad/KeyBoy.git
cd KeyBoy

# Open in Xcode
open KeyBoy.xcodeproj

# Or build via CLI
xcodebuild -scheme KeyBoy -configuration Release

# Create distributable DMG
./create-dmg.sh
```

## ü§ñ Prompt

> i want to create a simple apple app of some sorts that let's me use the right side CMD key with combinations to quickly swith apps. e.g. right CMD + G to open Ghostty terminal, CMD + W to open Wave etc.. plan this out accordingly. it needs to be very minimal. needs to stay on the top menu  bar as an simple emoji and clicking on it opens sort of like a futuristic window that has the key combos as key and the way to select the app that we wanna open. let's keep it very simple. minimal UI but functional. don't over engineer anything. also tests are not too important for now as long as we can run it. start with a spec.

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Use descriptive letters**: `g` for Ghostty, `x` for Xcode, `z` for Zoom.
- **Group by workflow**: Development apps on one side, communication on another
- **Test new shortcuts**: Always verify app paths before saving
- **Keep it simple**: 5-10 shortcuts are usually enough for most workflows
